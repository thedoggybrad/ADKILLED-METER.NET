It will display much better vs the Original OpenSpeedTest.
The platform is pre-configured to display on all web browsers without any problems.

My Goals is to provide an highly accurate Speed Test platform, to display Open Speed Test on mobile much better and to have a simple GUI vs the OpenSpeedTest.

This will provide the highly accurate Speed Test because of simple UI, therefore your Web Browser will load it much faster.

Project Type: Open-Source Project (but using Closed-Source Components)
